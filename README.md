Welcome to Hangman!
To play, download Hangman.zip and compile using "g++ *.cpp" (without quotes). 
While playing, you will find the option to select a difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the shorter the words get!

Guess characters until you've guessed the word! Guess too many times and you will complete the hangman drawing, losing the game :(.

Have fun!
